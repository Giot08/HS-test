Good afternoon, is a pleasure to be here, I Will introduce myself, I’m Jose Torres
a Junior Front end dev, at this opportunity I’ve made a small app, I’ll try to 
emulate the front end of an airway company where a user can book, they next 
flights.
The main idea was creating a strong app, where you can “update and charge” 
(for an example), money for emulate the buy of a ticket or a Booking, I can’t 
reach all in the time, that runs out today.

I’ve known all of you ask for make a Typescript project, my skill are low in 
Typescript, I’m working to grow that.

The Navbar, is just an example, the links don’t open anything.

I focused the dashboard of this app, as the main purpose, here I’ve work with 
JSON, making successfully the save of a Book on Local Storage, I fetch a json
and use it for make the destination link, also I use the code to verify each
data and make a logical use for booking, I call Ticket as the main object,
an object where you can save all data from your booking, So, in Book you 
cand select the country of your preference, I try for a long make the 
input “from” filters the countries, but when I do so, the entire app 
broke, need to investigate more about, that is why works more like a 
selection list.

The Trip and Class are part of the main json, but Trip can open the return 
input, the principal idea were made at least 4 destinations, more like a 
starting the flight, 2 optional and the flight ending.

Passenger was a bit fun, I figure an adult cant travel with too much kids, 
so, I make it can only travel 1 infant per 2 adults, the children are only 
limited to 9 like adults.

Working on dates I use de Date method to filter only possibilities since 
today to exactly 1 year later.

If you change to My trips, that will print all booking have made in a 
basic table, also I add the status, false for default to show if you are
checked or not. Also, I use the shortID library to make a random ID for
each Object.
And for the last I try to make the Check In unfortunately my time runs
out. They stay in the beginning.

Honestly, I’m not very proud of this app, more because I can’t reach the 
final product, I was thinking in create an admin panel to CRUD all object,
use an “client panel” with fake money so you will can’t Book anything what
go out of value, create the Responsive design of this web. Etc.

For an extra I like to show a bit fast an app I’ve made before for an exam,
here is full responsive design, and have an small  admin panel, was made
with Firebase.
